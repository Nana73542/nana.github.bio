            <p>This website is dsigned by <a href="#">Nana Awusi</a>,wesites developer.He attended Senior High School at <a href="#">ASSIN NORTH SENIOR HIGH TECHNICAL SCHOOL</a> in the <a href="#">ASSIN North District</a> which is in the CENTRAL REGION,GHANA.And he was raised in Assin Praso which is also in Assin North District-CENTRAL REGION,GHANA.He created this website to provide students with vital mathematics materials in the form of tutoring through videos,provision of past question &etc.</p>
            <br>mathematics is a core subject and at the same time an elective course offered at many levels in education, in a country like Ghana particular,without mathematics knowledge,one can not offer some course or profession.Example economics,Engineer,Computer Science&etc,one can not offer it at any higher institution without mathematical know how.So for this and some reasons,the author has designed this well structured website  to assist both core and elective mathematics students across nations.<br/>
            <h1><u><center>INTRODUCTION TO MATHEMATICS(<i>CORE&ELECTIVE<i>)</center></u></h1>
            <p>Mathematics is th the study of nunbers,quantities,shapes,patterns,and structures.It's a dicipline that involves logical reasoning,problem solving,and abstract thinking to understand and describe the ralationship between different mathematical materials.At it's core,mathematics provides tools for understanding patterns,making prediction,solving real-world problems,and explaining natural phenomena through concepts like algebra,geometry,calculus,and statistics.In a broader sense,mathematics can be divided into two main categories,namely;<i>Pure&Applied Mathematics.</i></p>

<h1><u><center><i>BINARY OPERATIONS</i></center></u></h1> 
                <li>In mathematics, a binary operation or dyadic operation is a rule for combining two elements (called operands) to produce another element. More formally, a binary operation is an operation of arity two.

                    More specifically, a binary operation on a set is a binary function whose two domains and the codomain are the same set. Examples include the familiar arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Other examples are readily found in different areas of mathematics, such as vector addition, matrix multiplication, and conjugation in groups.
                    
                    A binary function that involves several sets is sometimes also called a binary operation. For example, scalar multiplication of vector spaces takes a scalar and a vector to produce a vector, and scalar product takes two vectors to produce a scalar.
                    
                    Binary operations are the keystone of most structures that are studied in algebra, in particular in semigroups, monoids, groups, rings, fields, and vector spaces.</li>
